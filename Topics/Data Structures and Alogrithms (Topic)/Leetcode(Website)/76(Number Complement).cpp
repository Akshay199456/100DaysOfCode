/*
-------------------------Question:

Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2:

Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Constraints:

The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
num >= 1
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

/*
-------------------------My Approaches:

1. Using a vector to store the binary representation

We can use a vector to store the binary representation of a number. We just divide the number and get the
remainder as we move along and continue so till the number hits 0. If n is the no of bits used to represent
number:
n -> no of bits to represent number

Time complexity: O(n) 
Space complexity: O(n)
