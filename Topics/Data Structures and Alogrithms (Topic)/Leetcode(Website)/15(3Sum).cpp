/*
-------------------------Question:

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:

Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

/*
-------------------------My Approaches:

While I was able to obtain all possible answers to this problem including the duplicates in 
O(n^2) time complexity using the two-sum approach, I wasn't able to get the answer to this specific
problem where the duplicates can't occur in the final result. Hence my answer will not be valid
here
