I think the best plan to make and prepare myself for full-time opportunities requires a good data strucuture,
algorithm and system design understanding. Given that I am working 9-6 on weekdays on the internship, I need
to make the most of the remaining time to maximize the data I can collect for it. From my first 2 weeks,
I think the best way to maximize time to gather data for DSA is to explore the top interview section in
leetcode followed by the Blind 75 leetcode questions. The problems highlighted in these sections teach you
different ways to solve problems, knowledge which you can use to solve other problems which use the same
underlying concepts or a combination of the concepts. Based on the early data over th epast two weeks,
when you solve a problem from the April/May/June explore section, they are mostly easy level problems so
you are using techniques which you have already learnt and not gathering new data. Therefore, to maximize
the data you obtain, it's better to sovle problmes from the Top Interview questions since they give you
new understandings of different techniques which gives you data even if that means we will be solving the
problems over a few days due to a limit of time. Also, if we want to mix things up every once in a while,
we can solve the problems from the April/May/June explore sections on leetcode.

As always, as we get more data, we will be use that data to find better patterns and implement more
efficient solutions to problems.
