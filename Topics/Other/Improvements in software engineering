1. I should implement more the practice of thinking more and more about the problem that's given to me and gathering more 
data on it till I gather a good understanding of the problem before I actually start working on the code with respect to
solving it. This can include getting into 1-1 meetings with different people involved in the process as well as taking the
time to think, write down and understand the problem clearly. Once you have a good understanding of the problem from the
data and know of an approach to solving it, then only you should write code for it.
