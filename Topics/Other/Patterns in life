1. More the data, more better the patterns, more efficient the solutions to problems you can solve, much
better the quality of life.

2. The greater the effort you put in per day in ta task over a period of time, the greater the results you
obtain in that task over that period of time.

3. Given a problem, break down the bigger problem into smaller problems and continue to do so till you have
an individual unit. Collect data starting from the individual unit, find better patterns, implement more
efficient solutions to problems and move from the individual problem to the smaller problems to the bigger
problems as they follow a dynamice programming approach. Divid and conquer and dynamic programming approach
will help solve the problem.

4. Balance in everything is key to a good life. You have to find out what that balance is for you by figuring out what 
works for you and what don't and play around to find the right balance. I believe that it's that balance that makes you
happy inside. So, play aorund to find that balance in differnet aspects of your life and enjoy it.
