I think the best plan to make and prepare myself for full-time opportunities requires a good data strucuture,
algorithm and system design understanding. Given that I am working 9-6 on weekdays on the internship, I need
to make the most of the remaining time to maximize the data I can collect for it. From my first 2 weeks,
I think the best way to maximize time to gather data for DSA is to explore the top interview section in
leetcode followed by the Blind 75 leetcode questions. The problems highlighted in these sections teach you
different ways to solve problems, knowledge which you can use to solve other problems which use the same
underlying concepts or a combination of the concepts. Based on the early data over th epast two weeks,
when you solve a problem from the April/May/June explore section, they are mostly easy level problems so
you are using techniques which you have already learnt and not gathering new data. Therefore, to maximize
the data you obtain, it's better to sovle problmes from the Top Interview questions since they give you
new understandings of different techniques which gives you data even if that means we will be solving the
problems over a few days due to a limit of time. Also, if we want to mix things up every once in a while,
we can solve the problems from the April/May/June explore sections on leetcode.

As always, as we get more data, we will be use that data to find better patterns and implement more
efficient solutions to problems.

Plan for the next few months (end of summer) with respect to work and life.

1. Weekdays

During the weekdays we will be working 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. on our internship gathering data on different parts of development to make
ourself a better software engineer. Some days, we might work more hours as well depending on the work or if I want to get
done with something or I am loving working on whatever I am working on. 

We do take a break of 1 hour in between from 1 p.m. -2 p.m. During this one hour break, there are different things we can do
depending on what we are interested in. We can apply to companies for full-time and internship opportunities to improve my
interviewing skills. We cna continue working if I am in a state of flow. Or we can just relax and take a break.

At the end of the day, we relax for a while doing differnt things. There are a few things we can do here after relaxing.
We can choose to either do leetcode and gather data that way or work on the codePath's course to increase our knowledge in
data structures. We could also apply to companies or just relax depending on the day.


2. Weekends and Holidays

During the weekends, we do have more time available. As a result, we can use this time to work on different things.
We can spend time on data structures by either working on leetcode and gathering data or by walking through CodePath's
courses and gather data from there. We can also apply to more companies with respect to internship and full-time
opportunities to improve our interviewing skills. These are also good days to organize mock-interviews so that we gather 
data on data structures and algorithms so that we become better at it. 

We can use this time to experiement with different technologies, languages and frameworks to make ourslef a better software
engineer by working on different projects. If we have work from the internship end, we can also use time here to work on it.
Finally, we can use this time to apply to more companies for both internships and full-time opportunities.

Summer internship plan

What are the things we are going to be working on over the rest of the summer internship? Here's a few things:

1. Work on more defects and bugs. This will help you get more associated with the codebase and help you understand how
different sectios of the code interact with each other to build the product. Second, this includes writing unit tests and
mocking and as a result, this will help you become better at it.

2. Working on features with other memebers of the team. This could include working with Person1 and Person2 on the features
they are working on.

3. Working with Person1 to maybe work on the task they miught want help with which they initiallly discussed to be part of 
the intern project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(7/12/20)

Today was a good day. Got to relax mentally different from the past couple of weeks. I think what helped me relax today
was that I was able to relax mentally by contemlpating of life in general. This includes both on understanding and analyIng
the data on what I have been working on currently as well as planning and managing for the future. Also, I didn't spend
much time coding or appolying to jobs or doign anything along those lines. I just relaxed thinking about how I am doing right
now and how I can be improving my life for the future.

Plan from Fall 2021 semester

Going forward, we will be dividing our time between a few things:

1. Start off the day with checkign emails, applyign to companies and networking with more people.
2. After that, atleast until this Decemeber, we will be working 20 hours a week so we will maximize that time to better at 
software engineering.
3. Once we are done with work, we will be relaxing for a while after which we will start wokring on our own personal stuff
most of the time.
4. This will encompass most of the stuff we highlighted in the 'Improvements in Interviewing blog' with the same date.
5. End the day with a little bit more of networking and applying to companies.

Things to balance this semester:

1. 3 clases and associated homework and exams.
2. Internship
3. Wallbreakers coding stuff
4. Codepath DSA stuff to improve

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(10/25/20)

We have got a good balance of managing the different things that we are currently working on. The current plan is as follows.
We will be using this plan from now till we get a job and will be collecting data along the way to improve this process:

1. Monday - Friday
    > 8 a.m. - 10 a.m. : Focus on applying to companies and everything related to that.
    > 10 a.m. - 3 p.m. we will be focusing on internship.
    > 3 p.m - end of day: After that, the rest of the time will be spent on Codepath and preparing for interviews.

    Here, ww could add and change the routine as needed so that we could use more time in applying to companies as well.

2. Sat-Sun
    > Start the day with applying to conmapies for a couple of hours.
    > After that. on weekends, we will be spending time on getting up to date with the modules alloted for each class for that
    week. We want to make sure to minimize this time as much as needed only giving it as much time as required.
    > The rest of the time will be spent either working on Wallbreaker stuff.
    > If we have more free time, we will be spending it on CodePAth stuff to get better at interviewing and imporving that 
    procedure
    > We could end the day with applying to companies as well.


This will be the plan till the end of my graduation as the only change will be that I will interning for 30 hours next
smester which will be 6 hours every day which means I might have to start my day 1 hour early but we will adjust and find
the right balance for it. The good thing next semester is that we will only have 1 class so we have more time for either
preparing better for interviews or applying to more companies.

At somethign, we will be spending free time getting done with processes as required and using additional time to either prepare
better for interviews or applying to more companies. 

As we get more data, more data leads to more better patterns which leads to a better quality of life.

This is a good plan that we have curretnly set up where time is being used appropriatley for different tasks in the order of
their priority but as mentioned above, as we get more data, we will be coming up with more efficient solutions.

As required, we will be taking some time to relax when necessary but I like this plan so lets go forward with it.


Platofrms to apply to for companies:

1. LinkedIn
2. Github link to company appplications
3. Handshake
4. Angel list
5. Ripple Match
6. GHC memeber link
7. Other job portals like indeed, glassdoor and so on.

Solving problems in order of priority

It is important to solve porblems in the order of their priority. This allows you to maximize experiences by solving more
problems which gives you more data wich leads to a beter qualtiy of life. If you were do otherwise, you would lose out on
certain experiences which would lead to a poor quality of life. As a reuslt, we firszt solve problems that are of a higher
priority before moving to problems of a lower priority.

Maybe an interesting thought here

When working with any problem/solving a problem, we know that more the data, more better the patterns, more efficient the
solutions to the problem. However, a good mindset to have while we are solving these problems is this: prepare for the worst
case scenario and expect for the worst case scenario. Having this mindet, our prepartion going into any problem is that
since we are preparing for the worst case scenairo, we are going to a collect a lot and lot of data as that maximizes our
chance to solve the problem as more the data, more efficient the solution to the problem. However, it is also importnat to
rememeber that even though you might ahve put in a lot of effort and collected a lot of data, that doesn't gurantee succees.
It just reduces teh probability of failure. As a result, if you are expecting the worst case scenairo, you wont' be dejected
when even after your efforts, things didn;t go your way. This also keeps you in the right mindet to work even harder and 
collect even more data to find more better patterns.
