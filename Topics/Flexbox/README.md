## Description Of Project

The purpose of this project was to understand CSS Flexbox and how it could be utilized in order to make a page responsive as well as align elements within the page. As a result, no JS was written to make the page functional (Might add it later when testing a new framework or JS concepts). It only contains HTML+CSS to create and align the elements. However, using the CSS Flexbox Layout has made the page responsive irrespective of the screen size used.

From what I noticed, it's really easy to align items in a complex layout structure using CSS Flexbox. While it doesn't give the complete freedom in aligning items where you want to like CSS Grid allows, CSS Flexbox helps in aligning items really simple and quick without a whole lot of effort.
