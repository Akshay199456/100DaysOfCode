/*
Problem statement:

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example: 1
Input:
intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]]
newInterval = [2,5]
Output:
[[1,5],[6,9]]
Example: 2
Input:
intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]]
newInterval = [4,8]
Output:
[[1, 2], [3, 10], [12, 16]]
Example: 3
Input:
intervals = []
newInterval = [5,7]
Output:
[[5,7]]
Example: 4
Input:
intervals = [[1,5]]
newInterval = [2,3]
Output:
[[1,5]]
Example: 5
Input:
intervals = [[1,5]]
newInterval = [2,7]
Output:
[[1,7]]

/*
-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. merge interval

    we just push the new interval into the array, run sorting algorithm and then we can merge the new interval. there is nothing unique in that so i havent coded it

    Space complexity: O(1)
