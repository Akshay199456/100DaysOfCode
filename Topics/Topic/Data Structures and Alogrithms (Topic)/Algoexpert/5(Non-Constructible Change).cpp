-------------------------    Video Explanation 
the brute force approach would be to loop through all posisitve integers and keep looping till you can't create
a change. at every cent we are tuying to find, we would have to look at out input and determine if 
we can create that amount with those coinws. and that algorithms is not an efficient one.

if you don't know how to solve a problem, mpodify the input array, messa round with things, visualize
the proiblem a bit mroe and seee if you can come up with some inutitoion or something thats gonna
give some help.

in array problems, you can typically sory the input array and see what that's like.
