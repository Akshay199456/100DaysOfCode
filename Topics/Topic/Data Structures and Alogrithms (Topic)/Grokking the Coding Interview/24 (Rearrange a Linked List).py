Problem statement:

Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that the nodes from the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order. So if the LinkedList has nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null, your method should return 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> null.

Your algorithm should not use any extra space and the input LinkedList should be modified in-place.

Example 1:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> null
Output: 2 -> 12 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6 -> 8 -> null 
Example 2:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> null
Output: 2 -> 10 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> null

-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. Fast ald slow pointer

    We use the fast and slow pointer approach to find the middle of the linked list.
    once we find the middle of the linked list, we then reverse the second half of the linked
    list. at this point, the second half of the linked list either ahs the same number
    of elements as the first half or one more. we make slight modifications if it is one more.
    otherwise, we just move the pointers around.
