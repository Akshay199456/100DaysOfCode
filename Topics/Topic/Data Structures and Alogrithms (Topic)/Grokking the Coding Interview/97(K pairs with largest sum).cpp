/*
Problem statement:

Given two sorted arrays in descending order, find ‘K’ pairs with the largest sum where each pair consists of numbers from both the arrays.

Example 1:

Input: L1=[9, 8, 2], L2=[6, 3, 1], K=3
Output: [9, 3], [9, 6], [8, 6] 
Explanation: These 3 pairs have the largest sum. No other pair has a sum larger than any of these.
Example 2:

Input: L1=[5, 2, 1], L2=[2, -1], K=3
Output: [5, 2], [5, -1], [2, 2]

/*
-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. using max heap to store sum by going through all elementsof all arrays [not coded]

    we can use a double for loop to go through all of th eelements in the arrays and push therir sum into a max heap. we later retireve k pairs from it


    Time complexity: O(mn logmn)
    Space complexity: O(mn)
