/*
Problem statement:

Given the head of a LinkedList and two positions ‘p’ and ‘q’, reverse the LinkedList from position ‘p’ to ‘q’.

/*
-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. In-place reversal of list and dummy node

    We can use the in-place reveral and ummy node tcechnique to solve this problem.
    using the dummy node as the first node helps us as even if we are reversing the whole
    list, having the dummy node always makes it as a sub-list so it becomes easier to 
    change head.

    Dummy node is always a good option when you know that the state of the head node
    might change based on in-place manipulation.

    We then set pointers accordingly ro identify the sub beg and end as well as list beg and end
    and then reverse the list
