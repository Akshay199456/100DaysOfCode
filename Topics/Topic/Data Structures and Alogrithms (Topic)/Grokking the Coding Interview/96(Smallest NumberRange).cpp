/*
Problem statement:

Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the ‘M’ lists.

Example 1:

Input: L1=[1, 5, 8], L2=[4, 12], L3=[7, 8, 10]
Output: [4, 7]
Explanation: The range [4, 7] includes 5 from L1, 4 from L2 and 7 from L3.
Example 2:

Input: L1=[1, 9], L2=[4, 12], L3=[7, 10, 16]
Output: [9, 12]
Explanation: The range [9, 12] includes 9 from L1, 12 from L2 and 10 from L3.

-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. k way merge [not coded]

    we can use the k way merge pattern in order to create a list of all the elemnts in the arrays in theire sorted order. once we have that list,
    we can then use the two pointer technique to go through the intervals and see if we have a number in each of the lists within that interval.
    using the two pointer approach then would solve this problem
