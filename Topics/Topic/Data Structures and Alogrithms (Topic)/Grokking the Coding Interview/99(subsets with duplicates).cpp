/*
Problem statement:

Given a set of numbers that might contain duplicates, find all of its distinct subsets.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 3, 3]
Output: [], [1], [3], [1,3], [3,3], [1,3,3]
Example 2:

Input: [1, 5, 3, 3]
Output: [], [1], [5], [3], [1,5], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3], [3,3], [1,3,3], [3,3,5], [1,5,3,3]

/*
-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. use map and custom hash to store each vector [not coded
2. go through all n to see if it matches with any exisitng solution [not coded]

now we came up with 2 approaches to solve this problem neither of which we have coded since they both are not using the subset technqiue we learnt.
as a result, we can use any of those two approaches to solve the problem.
