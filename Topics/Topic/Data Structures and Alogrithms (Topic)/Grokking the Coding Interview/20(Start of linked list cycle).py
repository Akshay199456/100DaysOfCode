Problem statement:

Given the head of a Singly LinkedList that contains a cycle, write a function to find the starting node of the cycle.

 head  
    1   
    2   
    3   
    4   
    5   
    6   
 Cycle start  
 Examples:  
 Cycle start  
    1   
    2   
    3   
    4   
    5   
    6

-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. slow and fast pointer technqiue
    Start: 9:08 pm
    End: 9:24 pm

    we can first use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the post of intersection on
    the cycle adn then the distance from the begging of the linked list to the start
    of the cycle and from the intersection to the beginning of the cycle is the same. 
    so we push the pointer till they intersect and that is the result.
