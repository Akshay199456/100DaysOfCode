/*
Problem statement:

Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree. Write a function that returns the maximum sum.

A path can be defined as a sequence of nodes between any two nodes and doesnâ€™t necessarily pass through the root. The path must contain at least one node.
*/

/*
-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. Tree Depth First Search[Does not work]

    can apply the depth first search pattern here. get the left sum,, right sum and
    caclulate the max sum

    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(n)
