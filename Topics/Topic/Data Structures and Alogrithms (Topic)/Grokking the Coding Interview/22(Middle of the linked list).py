Problem statement:

Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to return the middle node of the LinkedList.

If the total number of nodes in the LinkedList is even, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> null
Output: 4

-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. slow and fast pointer approach

    Start: 8:25 pm
    End: 8:39 pm

    we can use the slow and fast pointer approach to solve this problem. always, the fast pointer
    is two steps ahead so whwen fast pointer is null or its next element is null, we are at the middle 
    of hthe linked list
