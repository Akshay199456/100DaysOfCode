/*
Problem statement:

We are given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from the range 0 to n. Since the array has only n numbers out of the total n+1 numbers, find the missing number.

Example 1:

Input: [4, 0, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [8, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 0, 1]
Output: 7

/*
-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. using the cyclic sort pattern and bit exor operation

    we can use the bit exor operation to ifn dht eolution ot the problem, by exoring every number with the index, at the very end the missing 
    number will be w=the only number that will remaing since every index will cancel off with its number.

    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(1)
