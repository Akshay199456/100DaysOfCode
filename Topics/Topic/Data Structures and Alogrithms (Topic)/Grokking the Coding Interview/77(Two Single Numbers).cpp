/*
Problem statement:

n a non-empty array of numbers, every number appears exactly twice except two numbers that appear only once. Find the two numbers that appear only once.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 2, 3, 5]
Output: [4, 6]
Example 2:

Input: [2, 1, 3, 2]
Output: [1, 3]

-------------------------    My Approaches:
1. [not coded]

    tbf, we cam yup with two approaches but none of those approaches are the exor approach.

    approach 1

    thee first apporach was using hashmap or hashset to store orccurences. when it is not present, we insert it. when it is
    present, we remove it. at the end, the ones that remain are the ones that have count 1.

    time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(n)


    approach 2

    we can sort the arry and then use two poitners to find the one which dont hae a duplicate occurrence

    Time complexity: O(nlogn)
    Space complexity: O(1)

    Space complexity: O()
