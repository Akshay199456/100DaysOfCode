Rather than creating a new project and making the page responsive for most device's, I will be working on the 'Instagram Landing Page' project which I designed using CSS Flexbox. Check it out to see the responsiveness of the project on different devices. The appropriate links for that project are given below:

## Notes

If you want to observe the responsiveness of the page on different devices, open the developer console and click on the 'Toggle Device Toolbar' option (Cmd + Shift + M) on Mac. While the responsiveness looks good on most devices, the icons seem to be very close to each other on an Iphone 5/SE device. I will be working on it later to make sure that the website is responsive on it as well. 

The main thing I want to take out from this project, especially with CSS Media Queries is that if you are developing a website for different range of devices rather than a few, it is always a good option to start from the mobile version of the website and then work up to the laptop version.
