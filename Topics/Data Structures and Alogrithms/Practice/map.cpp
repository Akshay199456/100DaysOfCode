/*
	Will implement it when I have the time. Most of the methods are same to that of unordered_map.
	
	Maps are basically like unordered_maps but the elements in maps are sorted by its key unlike a 
	Usually take O(log n) for their operations as it is implemented using a tree.

	Methods are:
		1. begin() -> iterator to beginning
		2. end() -> iterator to end
		3. empty() -> checks if map is empty
		4. size() -> returns the size of the map
		5. insert() -> inserts element. Inserts iterator to element if it exists else it inerts the element
		6. erase() -> erases elements
		7. clear() -> clears the map
		8. find() -> finds the element in the map and returns the iterator to it else returns map.end()
		9. count() -< returns the number of occurrences of the element in the map
