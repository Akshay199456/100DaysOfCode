# Current strategy of becoming better at data structures and algorithms

## Strategy

Currently, I am following the Explore section of Leetcode which provides a curated list of top asked interview questions for difficulty levels of easy, medium and hard. This seems to be a good starting point. Once I am done with this, I will research other resources that will provide a good list of questions that are useful from the web, reddit, Leetcode discussions...

## Problem solving

The way I am solving problems right now is that as soon as I am given a problem, I try to solve it by finding a solution to it; doesn't need to be an efficient solution. If I am able to come up with a solution, I try to analyze bottlenecks that can be avoided to make the code more efficient and proceed from there. However, either after spending a lot of time(45 min) trying to figure out the solution or the efficient solution and being unsuccessful, I will look at the better/ given solution in the solutions section or top rated submissions, understand the approach that they implemented by researching and then code it to get a good idead of it.

## Figuring our right structure to document code

Need to figure out the right structure to document all the code in the leetcode section so that I can understand the problem, solution, better appraoches and code with ease when I look at it later.
