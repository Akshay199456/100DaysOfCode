## Description of Project

This project was inspired by the Awwwards winning website [Loop Japan](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/loop-japan). While I have tried to recreate the landing page with animations, I am still in the process of making this page mobile friendly as I ran into initial issues while trying to. I have opened up an issue and will be working on it in my free time. However, the goal of this porject was to use animations in a helpful but not irritating sort of way which is in its current state.
