# #100DaysOfCode

Hello everyone! Welcome to my journey of 100 days of coding. Being an avid Twitter user and following several engineers and developers on the platform, I have been inspired by them to follow my own journey into coding for 100 days and eventually making it a habit where I would love to code/work on projects everyday. For those who don't know me, my background section should give you a quick glimpse into me.

## Background

I have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from the University of Houston. During my undergrad, I got to work on a whole lot of projects related mostly on hardware but I got to work on a few software projects as well. During this time, I discovered that I was way more passionate about coding related projects that were handed over to me and as a result, as soon as I completed my undergrad, I enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp at General Assembly(GA) in San Francisco.

During my time at GA, I got the opportunity to work with several peers on coding projects with respect to full stack web development using technologies focused on the MERN stack. Check out my GitHub profile if you want to take a look into the projects I built during this time.

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Software Engineering at the University of Houston to integrate my background in software engineering with industry specific knowledge related to the field.
